## Purpose And Goal

After lots of understanding how CSS really work I kind of understand how the rules are correctly
implemented.

I decided that I want to push my self by building Weather Forecast application which I named Neulan.
You may wonder what the heck is Neulan is? I don't know either, it's randomly generated name from
shady website.

## General Requirement

Apart from the usual bare minimum that average website require, the website must be fast and
responsive for any devices. I had a few requirements to be able to call this project a success:

- The user interface should be generic yet beautiful and simple, and imitate Material UI as main
  reference
- Users should be able to use Neulan easily without getting confused by its interface.
- Implement features that are really helpful for the users.

## Challenges

It was fairly easy to build this website. However, there's some difficulties at some point that I
almost give up on designing Neulan, I ended up looking on the internet about Weather App design.

Then I stumbled upon
[Srawana on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/18425258-Srawana-Weather-Dashboard-Design). It's
surprisingly fits to what I have been searching, special shout out to the author you just saved me a
alot of time!.

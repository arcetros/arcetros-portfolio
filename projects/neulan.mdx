## Task

After lots of understanding how CSS really work I kind of understand how the rules are correctly
implemented, at that moment I wanted to build something simple from the ground up and decided to
built a weather forecast applicaton. It has to be fast, responsive and have a beautiful interfaces.

## Technical Details

Apart from the usual bare minimum that average website require, the website must be fast and
responsive for any devices. Like many of weather app on the internet, Neulan is built using
[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), to style the website I used
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Additional Details:

- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) provides weather forecast data and cities name
  data.
- [geolocation-db](https://geolocation-db.com/json/) to get consumer website's ip address.
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) to helps simplify redux development.

## Challenges

It was fairly easy to build this website. However, there's some difficulties at some point that I
almost give up on designing Neulan, I ended up looking on the internet about Weather App design.

Then I stumbled upon
[Srawana on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/18425258-Srawana-Weather-Dashboard-Design). It's
surprisingly fits to what I have been searching, special shout out to the author you just saved me a
alot of time!.
